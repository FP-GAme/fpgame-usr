This folder contains the source file for the FP-GAme tech demo. The code is documented, so check it
out if you want to learn the recommended style of FP-GAme programming.

Another good resource can be found under docs/fpgame_developers_manual.pdf, which goes into detail
about our hardware's capabilities and the best practices in FP-GAme programming.
