 * @brief Exposes the controller interface to the user
 *
 * The controller interface consists of a single function, which can be
 * called to get the current controller state.
 *
 * The controller state is returned as an integer, with each button represented
 * in a single bit. Masks are provided to access the bits which represent each
 * button. Note that the signal received from the controller is active low:
 * a 1 in the bit for a button means the button is *released*.
 *
 * In addition to the masks provided, macros are provided to check if a button
 * is currently pressed or released given a button mask and a state.
