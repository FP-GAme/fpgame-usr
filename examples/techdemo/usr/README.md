# techdemo/usr

This usr folder is where the FP-GAme user libraries should be copied to upon building them.

Users who haven't tried modifying the user libraries (which is done here
https://github.com/FP-GAme/fpgame-src) do not have to worry about this folder. Whenever you compile
the techdemo or reuse this folder for your own projects, our provided Makefile will automatically
include the user libraries here.

Updated libraries built from source are already included here in this repo. So no need to build them
yourself (unless you have made changes to them).
