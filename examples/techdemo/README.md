# techdemo
This directory contains the source and build information for the FP-GAme Tech Demo.

## About techdemo
The techdemo was developed in a hurry (busy students), so the actual art and gameplay may not
showcase the full capabilities of FP-GAme.
However, it shows "proof of concept" for each of the main components of the FP-GAme system:
* Scrolling background and foreground tile layers (plus an extra tile animation trick!)
* Moving sprite with animation, controlled by SNES controller
* One-shot audio sound effect, also controlled by the SNES controller

## How to Build
Given that you have followed the steps to install the development toolchain in
docs/fpgame_developers_manual.pdf, all you need to do is run `make` in this directory.
