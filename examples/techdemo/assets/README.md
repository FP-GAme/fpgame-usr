# techdemo/assets
While not mandatory for every game, we organized our game's loadable assets into an "assets" folder.
The techdemo loads these upon startup to construct the tiles of the gameworld and load pattern
graphics.

All of these assets were built using Tiled and Piskel, and exported to the formats you see here with
our tools in user_tools.
