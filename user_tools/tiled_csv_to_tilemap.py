# Turns a .csv file exported from Tiled into a .mif file for use with our Tile-RAM.
# This program is very strict about the format of the input file.
# The input file must be:
# * A .csv file.
# * Each comma separated entry has a single 32-bit integer.
# * The first 3 MSBs of the 32-bit integers are reserved, and the top of those two indicate the
# *   horizontal mirror and vertical mirror. The 3rd MSB should be 0, as rotations are incompatible
# *   with FP-GAme.

# Tiled can be found here:
# https://www.mapeditor.org/
